This exam is comprised of six problems, each problem being a full page of related 
questions.  You must choose THREE of these problems to answer.  You cannot answer
more than three problems.  Review all of the questions and consider what answer you 
would give to EACH part before deciding which three to answer.  All problems have the 
same value.


Read each question CAREFULLY, make sure you understand EXACTLY what question is being 
asked and what type of answer is expected, and make sure that your answer clearly and 
directly responds to the asked question.   Many students lose many points for answering 
questions other than the one I asked.  If you are unsure of what a question is asking 
for, raise your hand and ask.  


I am looking for depth of understanding and the ability to solve real problems.  
I want to see specific answers.  One-liners and vague generalities will receive 
little or no credit.  Superficial answers that I may have accepted previously
will not be accepted on this exam.  


None of these questions requires long answers, but many of the questions may require 
you to do a lot of thinking and sketching before you come up with a reasonable answer.
Feel free to use scratch paper to organize your thoughts.  If the correct part of your
answer is buried under a mountain of rambling, we may not find it.


If you need more space, you can overflow onto the back page.  Note (on the problem
page) that you are doing this.

If you answer more than three problems, we will only grade the first three.
If you change your mind, cross out the problems you do not want us to grade.
