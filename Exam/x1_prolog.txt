	This is a closed-book, no-notes exam.

	All questions are of equal value. Most questions have multiple parts.
	You must answer every part of every question. Read each question
	CAREFULLY; Make sure that

		you understand EXACTLY what question is being asked 

		what type of answer is expected

		your answer clearly and directly responds to the asked question

	Many students lose many points for answering questions other than the
	one I asked. Misunderstanding a question may be evidence that you
	have not mastered the underlying concepts. 
	
		If you are unsure about what a question is asking for, raise 
		your hand and ask. 
		
		Spend more time thinking and less time writing. Short and clear 
		answers get more credit than long, rambling or vague ones. 
		
		Write carefully. I do not grade for penmanship, spelling or 
		grammar, but if I cannot read or understand your answer, 
		I cannot give you credit for it.
