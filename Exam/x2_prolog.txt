	All questions are of equal value.  Most questions have multiple parts.
	You must answer every part of every question.  Read each question 
	CAREFULLY;  Make sure you understand EXACTLY what question is being
	asked and what type of answer is expected, and make sure that your
	answer clearly and directly responds to the asked question.

	Many students lose many points for answering questions other than the
	one I asked.  Misunderstanding a question may be evidence that you
	have not mastered the underlying concepts.  If you are unsure about
	what a question is asking for, raise your hand and ask.  Spend more
	time thinking and less time writing.  Short and clear answers get
	more credit than long, rambling or vague ones.  Write carefully.  I
	do not grade for penmanship, spelling or grammar, but if I cannot read 
	or understand your answer, I can't give you credit for it.
