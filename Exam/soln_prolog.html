<P>
These answers are longer than the answers that you were required to give.
I give longer answers because my goal is not merely to "tell you the right
answers" but to ensure that you understand them.
These are not the only answers that I will accept for full credit.  They are
merely the best answers that I could come up with.  
We will read each of your 
answers and try to grade it on the basis of how well you 
<ol type="a">
        <li>understood the problem</li> 
	<li>addressed the issues</li>
</ol>
If you found different, but comparably valid, ways to answer a question,
you will receive full credit.  
Note, however, that you will not receive credit
for misunderstanding the questions, or answering questions other than the
ones I was asking.  I was in the room to answer questions about the
meaning or intent of the problems.
You will also not receive full credit for giving weak answers that indicate
unclear understanding, or failure to recognize key points.
</P>
