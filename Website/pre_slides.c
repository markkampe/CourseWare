	<P>
	These are the slides used in the scheduled lectures. Each set of slides is in pdf format,
	six slides to the page.
	I do not intend to read, or even reference, all of these slides in the lecture. They are:
	<UL>
		<LI>to let you know what will be covered under each topic</li>
		<LI>for reference and illustration during discussions</li>
		<LI>to remind me of key points I wanted to cover, and the order in which I wanted to cover them</li>
		<LI>to save you the trouble of writing down notes that I have already committed to writing</li>
		<LI>to enable you to review material that has been covered (for exam review)</li>
	</UL>
