The repos for the CS105 projects are under a few different accounts, and I shouldn't be moving them around.
These few files allow me to make my own copies:

   - Makefile: clone and update, build and clean each project
   - push.sh: push my (locally) built pdf and tar files to my website
   - VSC.html: instructions for getting started with Visual Studio Code (s.b. in a more official place)
