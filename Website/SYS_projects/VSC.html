<title>Using Visual Studio Code on a remote server</title>
</head>
<body>
<P>
Most of the labs in this course involve writing and testing C code on
a Linux system. Most of your notebooks are likely running MacOS or
Windows, which will not be able to run most of these projects.
Fortunately we have a departmental Linux server (wilkes.cs.hmc.edu)
set up for your use.  You will need to:
<ul>
    <li> If you do not already have one, get a cs.hmc.edu account, 
         confirm that you can log in with it.<br>
	 It would be best if you got this under control before 
	 showing up for the first lab session.</li>
	<P></P>
    <li> From your notebook (or a lab machine), open an <em>ssh</em> 
         (<em>putty</em> on Windows systems) session to wilkes.cs.hmc.edu
	 and confirm that you are able to log in.<br>
	 Create a new sub-directory for your projects in this course:
	 <pre>
 wilkes% cd			# make sure you are in your $HOME directory
 wilkes% mkdir CS105_projects	# you can choose any name you like
 wilkes% 
	 </pre>
	 </li>
    <li> If you do not already have it, download and install 
    	 <A href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</A>
	 (from Microsoft) on your personal machine, and add the 
	 <A href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh">remote ssh connection</A> 
	 extension.
	 <br>
	 Open a remote Visual Studio connection to wilkes.cs.hmc.edu,
	 and change to the new sub-directory you created for these projects.
	 <br>
	 In the remote session, start a terminal session so you can type
	 shell commands to compile and run your programs.
	 </li>
	<P></P>
    <li> You may find that Visual Studio regularly asks you to re-enter your password
	to establish new connections.  If this becomes bothersome, you can (there are
	numerous tutorials on the internet):
	<ul>
	    <li>If you do not already have one, use the 
		<A href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a>
		command to create a new RSA public/private key pair
		on your personal notebook (do not do this on a lab machine).</li>
	    <li>install a copy of the public key (<em>id_rsa.pub</em>,with rw-------
		protection) in the 
		<em>.ssh</em> sub-directory of your $(HOME) directory on Wilkes.</li>
	</ul>
	Once you have done this, <em>ssh</em> and <em>Visual Studio</em> should be able
	to automatically log in to Wilkes (from your personal notebook) without your
	needing to enter your password.
	</li>
</ul>
<P>
There are (at least) two ways to get a lab-starter onto Wilkes:
<ul>
   <li>	download it onto your local machine, and then drag that file into
   	the (remote session) <em>Visual Studio</em> Explorer window.</li>
   <P></P>
   <li> in a remote terminal session, use the Linux 
	<A href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wget.1.html">wget</a>
	command to directly download the lab-starter onto Wilkes.
	<pre>
wilkes% wget https://cs.hmc.edu/courses/cs105/projects/bits-handout.tar
wilkes%
	</pre>
	Note: you can copy the URL for the hand-out by hovering over the link
	(e.g. in the course schedule) and doing a right-click "copy link location",
	and then paste it after your wilkes <em>wget</em> command.
	</li>
</ul>
Either way you will then have to use the Linux
<A href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html">tar</a>
command to extract the files:
<pre>
	wilkes% tar xvf bits-handout.tar
	wilkes%
</pre>
In most cases, this will create a new sub-directory just for that project.
