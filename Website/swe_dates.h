<P>
This course is about software project skills other than programming
(e.g. concept development, requirements, architecture and design, reviews,
testing, and management).  You will be asked to form teams and come 
up with a <a href="projects.html">single (large) project</a> concept.  
Then, over the course of the semester, you will work on different 
problems within that one project:
