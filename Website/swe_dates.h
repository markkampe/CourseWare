	<LI> Project Due Dates (submission via <A Href=SUBMIT_URL>SUBMIT</A>)
		<P>
			Projects follow quickly after the readings and lectures in which 
			the associated principles are presented.
			Project deliverables are spread (relatively) uniformly throughout 
			the course (one per week).
			This is done to keep you from getting in trouble when
			you discover that you cannot complete a three week project in 
			two days.
			Each deliverable is due a few
			days after the associated lab session, and most of them require
			you to encounter, recognize and solve one or two non-trivial problems.
			If you start the projects
			before the associated lab session, you will have already encountered 
			the difficulties, and we can help you during the lab session.  
			If you wait until the lab session to start a project, the session 
			will be over before you have even encountered the real problems, 
			and you will have to solve them on your own.
