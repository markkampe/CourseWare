<H2>INTRODUCTION:</H2>
<P>
Students will form two-person teams, choose topics generally related to scheduled lectures, 
research some interesting aspect of that topic, and deliver a brief in-class presentation
followed by a brief class discussion or activity.  Each student will participate in two such
teams (with a different partner).
</p>

<H2>ACTIVITY OBJECTIVES:</H2>
<ul>
	<li> To develop and demonstrate the ability to do research into current OS-related topics.</li>
	<li> To develop and demonstrate the ability to prepare and deliver Transfer-of-Information presentations.</li>
	<li> To develop additional depth and explore interesting issues beyond the planned course syllabus.</li>
</ul>

<H2>DELIVERABLES:</H2>
<ol type="1">
	<li> Sign up for dates and topics. </li>
	<li> Research bibliography and notes (brief and crude are acceptable).</li>
	<li> 5-10 minute presentation during some lecture session.</li>
	<li> 5-10 minute class discussion, Q&A, or related activity.</li>
	<li> Outline for the planned presentation and activity.</li>
	<li> A brief note on your respective roles in the preparations.</li>
</ol>

<H2>DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<P>
Review the lecture schedule, choose a topic you find interesting, and sign up for a day.  
There will be only one student presentation per day, and days will be allocated 
on a first-come-first-served basis.
</p>
<P>
Find/choose a subject within your selected topic, and do additional research
(beyond the assigned reading) to learn more about it.  Take notes on what you
discover, prepare an outline for what you believe will be an interesting and
valuable presentation, and develop a plan for how to engage the rest of the
class in this subject (e.g. provocative questions, team activities, Q&A).
</p>
<P>
On the appointed day, you will (jointly) give your presentation and lead
your activity.  In most cases, this will be at the beginning of the session
... but we can discuss whether or not some other dove-tailing with the scheduled
lecture topics might make more sense.
</P>

<H2>SUBMISSION:</H2>
<P>
Teams and dates can be registered in person or via e-mail.<br>
Bibliographies, notes, and outlines can be delivered on paper or via e-mail.
</P>
