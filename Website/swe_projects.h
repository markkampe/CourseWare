<P>
This course is about software project skills other than programming
(e.g. concept development, requirements, architecture and design, reviews,
testing, and management).  You will be asked to form teams, and come 
up with a single (large) project concept.  
Then, over the course of the semester, you will work on different 
aspects of that one project:

		Your submissions should not assume that your readers have
		access to any special or proprietary software.  
		The best submission formats are probably:
		<ul>
		    <li>ASCII text for simple prose</li>
		    <li><em>pdf</em> or <em>Google Docs</em> URLs for formatted reports w/figures</li>
		    <li><em>csv</em> or <em>Google Sheets</em> URLs for spread sheets</li>
		</ul>

		We will in many cases be looking at how plans or specifications have evolved.
		This can be captured with <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> commits, 
		or by enabling history in
		<a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en-GB">Google Docs</a>.
