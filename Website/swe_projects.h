<P>
This course is about software project skills other than programming
(e.g. concept development, requirements, architecture and design, reviews,
testing, and management).  You will be asked to form teams, and come 
up with a single (large) project concept.  
Then, over the course of the semester, you will work on different 
aspects of that one project:

	<sup>1</sup> Submissions are (modulo late-day-use) due by midnight at the end of the due date.<br>
	<sup>2</sup> The same 
		<a href="projects.html#submission">general submission process</a>

		Each deliverable (including how it will be graded) is 
		described in the associated

		Your submissions should not assume that your readers have
		access to any special or proprietary software.  
		The best submission formats are probably:
		<ul>
		    <li>ASCII text for simple prose</li>
		    <li><em>pdf</em> or <em>Google Docs</em> for formatted reports w/figures</li>
		    <li><em>csv</em> or <em>Google Sheets</em> for spread sheets</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		We will in many cases be looking at how plans or specifications have evolved.
		This can be captured with <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> commits, 
		or by enabling history in
		<a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en-GB">Google Docs</a>.
