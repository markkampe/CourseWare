Students are assumed to have a good understanding of programming and 
exploiting the features of programming languages and libraries.
<br>
But interesting software is sufficiently subtle and complex that it is not usually
possible to sit down, think about it for a few minutes, and start coding.
<br>
Building working software requires tools, discipline, and methodology.
<br>
This is a course in software development concepts, issues and methodologies,
whose goal is to develop:
<ul>
    <li> your ability to orgnize and effectively manage
         large and complex team projects.</li>
    <li> your ability to gather, define, clarify and validate requirements for 
         non-trivial software projects.</li>
    <li> methodologies to approach the creation of good
         specifications, architecture, designs, and test plans
	 for efficient and robust software.</li>
    <li> your ability to understand, describe, and review 
         complex software systems and development processes.</li>
    <li> an understanding of a range of software development processes
         and the types of project to which they are best suited.</li>
    <li> your ability to recognize, analyze, discuss, and address the
         problems that arise in such efforts.</li>
</ul>

This is a very practical course dealing with real-world problems, the issues
that complicate them, and the approaches that have been successfully applied
to their solution.
