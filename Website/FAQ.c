<STRONG>Where I'm coming from</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>
I have spent over forty-five years in the operating systems business,
as a developer, architect, manager, and in a variety of staff roles.
I have been very active in the development and refining of engineering
tools and processes.  I have always loved teaching.  
I teach this course because it is critical material,
and I care about helping the next generation of engineers master it.

Software is, in one way or another, what most of us are going
to do for a living.  Anybody can cob-together a few hundred lines 
of code that does more or less what (s)he wants.  Figuring out
what a complex system has to do, how to structure it to meet a
myriad of today's (and tommorow's) requirements, organizing and
managing the construction to reliably deliver it, creating a 
testing regime to meaningfully assess its correctness, and being
able to measure all of the above is more difficult.
<P>
Large software projects are among the most complex things
that human beings have ever constructed, and organizing and
controlling them is a hard problem.  The problems are far
too complex to have closed-form solutions ... but there are
tools and techniques that can make them more tractable.  
This is a course in the concepts, issues, and techniques
surrounding modern software construction.  It is material
you will definitely use, and I hope you will find it interesting.

<A href="why_I_love_OS.html>"> Why I love operating systems </A>
<P>
Operating Systems are among the most reliable and performance-critical
software ever written.
They provide the foundations for almost all applications,
and many of the challenges that interesting 
applications face today (security, data access, 
parallel processing and synchronization, distributed processing,
efficiency, scalability) were long ago addressed (at much greater
scales) by operating systems.
If you are to confront these problems, you need to study the
ways that that have been solved in the evolution operating systems.
<P>
This is not a class in <em>how to build operating systems</em>,
as that is something that very few people (of whom I am proud
to be one) will ever do.  Rather this is a class in which 
you will study:
<ul>
   <li> the ways computer architectures have
        evolvoed to support modern needs, and the ways that
        operating systems exploit those features.</li>
   <li> the fundamental objects that are implemented by
        operating systems, why they have the properties
        they do, and how to exploit them for your own
        purposes.</li>
   <li> major problems (e.g. resource allocation,
        multi-processing, scheduling, data storage,
        synchronization, and distributed processing)
        that have been addressed by operating systems,
        and the approaches and lessons that can be
        learned from them.</li>
</ul>

<STRONG>General Administrative Information</STRONG>
<UL>
<P>
Information on the course goals, contents and administrative 
procedures for the course can be found in the slides for the
<a href="slides/lecture_1.pdf">first lecture</A>.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Lecture and Assignment Schedule</STRONG>
<UL>
The subjects for all lectures, the reading assignments, and the dates 
of all exams are described in the 
<a href="schedule.html">course schedule</A>.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Lecture Notes</STRONG>
<UL>
Copies of <a href="slides/index.html">lecture slides</A> are always available
on line, but you are strongly encouraged to attend the lectures.  
<P>
You are free to print off and study slides for any lecture any time,
but it if you print out slides well in advance of the associated
lecture you should recheck them shortly before the lecture, as I
try to improve lectures each time I give them.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG>Quizzes and Examinations</STRONG>
<UL>
   <li> Information on what I am testing for in
	<a href="syllabus.html#quizzes">quizzes</a>
   	and 
	<a href="syllabus.html#exams">exams</a>
        can be found in the
	<a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>.  </li>
   <li> I do not give make-ups for quizzes.  
   	I do give make-up exams (different from the original exams, 
	a few weeks after the end of the semester), 
	but only in cases medical necessity (as substantiated by the 
	physician who was treating you at the time).  </li>
</UL>


<STRONG>Grades and Grading</STRONG>
<UL>
	The grading formula can be found in the
	<A href="syllabus.html#grading">course syllabus</a>.
	<P>
	I do not grade on a curve, but I try to calibrate my
	assignments and standards, and the breaks usually wind
	up within a few points of 90/80/70/60.
	<P>
	I am always willing to explain why I scored an answer in a 
	particular way, to fix arithmetic errors, and to regrade
	questions where I misunderstood your answer (but not where
	your answer was confused or you misunderstood the question).
	If I make a mistake in a question (making it too hard to answer 
	correctly), I try to find a way to compensate you for 
	my mistake.  Other than that, you get the grade you earned.  
	<P>
	I never change grades in response to excuses or hardship stories.
	If you need a good grade in this course, you need to earn it.
