<h2> Quizzes</h2>
<P>
There is a (Sakai) quiz that must be completed prior to each lecture session.
These are timed (5 mintues) closed book quizzes intended to be non-difficult 
if you have done the reading.  Most questions can be answered in a one-digit
number of words.  
I am not looking for essay answers or even complete sentences ... just enough
to show that you remember a few details from the reading.
</P>
<h2> Supplementary Reading</h2>
</p>
<H3>Git and GitHub</h3>
<P>
You will need to get set up on <em>GitHub</em> and learn basic <em>git</em> use.
I have created a 
<A href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/markkampe/Big-Software/blob/master/info/git.html">Git Cheat Sheet</A>
that:
<UL>
	<li> steps you through the getting started process</li>
	<li> points you at basic concepts and commands documentation</li>
	<li> points you at documentation on few more advanced topics</li>
	<li> provides a summary of the most commonly used git commands</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Or, if you would like a more comprehensive introduction, Udacity offers
a free 
<A href="https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123">Version Control with Git</a> course.
</P>
In addition to using <em>github</em> for version control, you will almost
surely want to use it to track the many tasks associated with each project.
I strongly encourage you to use:
<UL>
	<li> <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues">
		GitHub Issues</a> to describe all the work that must be done</li>
	<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards">
		GibHub Project Boards</a> to organize and track the status of
		the work to be completed next
	    <ul>
		<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-project-board">
			Creating Project Boards</A></li>
		<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-a-project-board">
			Editing Project Boards</A></li>
		<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board">
			Adding Issues to a Project Board</A></li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
</UL>

</p><h3>McConnell, chapters 10-19 and 24</h3>
This course involves considerable reading ... and yet it touches only
superficially on many important subjects.  The projects require
so much planning activity that there is little time left for actual
implementation.  I believe (and I hope you will agree) that this course
will make good use of the semester ... but many students enter this
course hoping to gain more (and large-project) programming experience.
I respect this desire, but I couldn't find enough hours in the semester.
</P><p>
The primary text for this course (McConnell, Code Complete) actually
has several excellent chapters on variables (chapters 10-13),
programming (chapters 14-19) and refactoring (chapter 24).
The only reasons I do not assign these chapters are:
</p><ul>
   <li> they would turn an already heavy reading burden into a crippling one.</li>
   <li> they are outside of the (software engineering vs programming)
   	key learning objectives that I have established for this course.</li>
</ul>
If, however, you want to be exposed to a well articulated collection
of programming lessons that it normally takes a decade or more to learn, 
I strongly recommend that you read (and carefully study) chapters 10-19
and 24 of Code Complete. 
<p>
<h3>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</h3>
<P>
This book by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides (the Gang of Four) is 
considered by many to be one of the foundations of object oriented design.
Design patterns will not solve all of your problems, but studying and 
using them will make you a better programmer.  I did not make it required
reading for this class because it would have taken us too deeply into
programming, but if you have not already read it, I strongly encourge
you to do so.
