<H2>Users and Use Cases</H2>
<UL>
    <li> identify distinct classes of your users
    	<ul>
	    <li>what usefully distinguishes each sub-class?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> identify key goals/operations for each
    	<ul>
	    <li>who are the participants in this operation?</li>
	    <li>diagram these as UML use cases</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> be prepared to share with the class
    	<ul>
	    <li>why you chose those classification criteria</li>
	    <li>how well/completely these use cases captures your program</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="prototypes">
<H2>Modeling and Prototyping</H2>
<UL>
    <li> consider user facing functionality where understanding/usability might be an issue (5-7 minutes)
    	<ul>
	    <li>how would you mock-up what?</li>
	    <li>whom would you ask to use it how?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> consider new technologies (e.g. languages, tool kits, APIs, services)
    	 that you are planning to use (5-7 minutes)
    	<ul>
	    <li>what might be hard to master, or might not do what you need?</li>
	    <li>what things to you need to be assured of before you can
	    	safely base your plans on each?</li>
	    <li>what is the simplest project that would answer each question?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> be prepared to share what you discover
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="quality">
<H2>Quality and Quality Assurance</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Define important <em>quality</em> attributes for your product (other than code-correctness)
    	 based on your competitive research and user interviews.
    </li>
    <li> Refine those definitions to be measurable statements, and suggest a means of testing each.
    </li>
    <li> Suggest things you can do (in your design and development process) to ensure each.
    </li>
    <li> Be prepared to share your results
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="U/I">
<H2>User Interface Design</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Consider your application
    	<ul>
	    <li>enumerate the key information content elements</li>
	    <li>enumerate the key user goals/tasks</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> in that context
    	<ul>
	    <li>identify natural task based navigation paths</li>
	    <li>identify natural content structure relationships</li>
	    <li>note the information to be gathered or displayed on each path</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> be prepared to share with the class
    	<ul>
	    <li>what was obvious and/or simple (not a problem)?</li>
	    <li>what was not obvious/simpe, and what did you decide?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="routine">
<H2>Routine Level Design</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Consider a non-trivial component in your product:
    	<ul>
	    <li>what non-obvious aspect must developers/reviewers understand?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Consider design representations:
    	<ul>
	    <li>UML diagrams (e.g. use case, state, interaction, swim-lane)</li>
	    <li>Doxygen/PyDoc/etc</li>
	    <li>decision tables</li>
	    <li>simple prose?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Answer:
    	<ul>
	    <li>What story are you trying to tell, and why is that the right story?</li>
	    <li>Which form would best tell, and why?</li>
	    <li>Once this story has been told, is the component now fairly clear?</li>
	    <li>What other component/story in your project would demand a different choice?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="patterns">
<H2>Architectural, Class, and Behavioral Patterns</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Consider an interesting problem
    	<ul>
	    <li>ideally one in your own project</li>
	    <li>consider <em>patterns</em> that might speak to this problem</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Sketch a solution without resourse to design patterns
    	<ul>
	    a reasonable solution, not a straw-man
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Sketch a solution using the chosen design pattern
    	<ul>
	    <li>how well did it address your problem?</li>
	    <li>how easy was it to apply this pattern to your problem?</li>
	    <li>does this cause you to think of changes to your architecture?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Be prepared to discuss your results</li>
</UL>

<A name="robust">
<H2>Software Robustness</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Consider an at-risk component in your project
    	<ul>
	    <li>something that does things that might reasonably fail,
	        more interesting problems than <em>bad user input</em></li>
	    <li>interacts with external services that might refuse, fail or be unavailable</li>
	    <li>complex process whose success has many pre-requisites</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> suggest a list different things that might give rise to a <em>fault</em>
    	 (incorrect or undexpected result).
    	<ul>
	    <li>rank each by likelihood and impact</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> for the top 2-3 problems on your list:
    	<ul>
	    <li>describe how you would determine that each had occurred</li>
	    <li>describe an appropriate recovery or containment strategy</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Be prepared to discuss your results</li>
</UL>

<A name="integration">
<H2>Integration and Testing Strategy</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Consider each component you have chosen for phases 3 and 4.
    	<ul>
	    <li>what portions of its functionality is dependent on other components?</li>
	    <li>how thoroughly can this component be tested in isolation?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Consider building a dummy (test) module for the required external functionality.
	<ul>
	    <li>how completely and accurately could you simulate those other components?</li>
	    <li>how would you control the behavior of those simulations to enable the desired testing?</li>
	    <li>how easy would it be to build those simulations?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> What approach makes the most sense?
    	<ol type="1">
	    <li> no external functionality is required </li>
	    <li> an easily built simulation could provide all of the required functionality </li>
	    <li> do initial testing with a simulation, but add additional test cases
	    	 after the real components are available</li>
	    <li> this component cannot reasonably be built and tested until others are available.</li>
	</ol>
    </li>
    <li> What demo would you plan to give?
    	 And if you are not planning on completing enough components for a fully
	 functional product, what dummy component(s) would you have to build in
	 order to give a compelling demonstration of the functionality you 
	 did implement?
    </li>
    <li> Be prepared to discuss your results</li>
</UL>

<A name="systest">
<H2>System Testing</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Consider the unit test cases for your chosen components
    	<ul>
	    <li>what <em>whole-product</em> functionality is not yet well exercised?</li>
	    <li>what additional system test cases should you add to cover them?</li>
	    <li>might you also have installation, security or other <em>beyond the code</em> issues?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Consider the computation, major I/O, and external services you use
    	<ul>
	    <li>might any operations involve significant costs/delays?</li>
	    <li>how might you measure (and track) delays due to <em>those causes</em>?</li>
	    <li>does this cause you to consider design and/or testing changes?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> Be prepared to discuss your results</li>
</UL>
