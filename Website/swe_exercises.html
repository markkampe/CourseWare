<H2>Users and Use Cases</H2>
<UL>
    <li> identify distinct classes of your users
    	<ul>
	    <li>what usefully distinguishes each sub-class?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> identify key goals/operations for each
    	<ul>
	    <li>who are the participants in this operation?</li>
	    <li>diagram these as UML use cases</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> be prepared to share with the class
    	<ul>
	    <li>why you chose those classification criteria</li>
	    <li>how well/completely these use cases captures your program</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="prototypes">
<H2>Modeling and Prototyping</H2>
<UL>
    <li> consider user facing functionality where understanding/usability might be an issue (5-7 minutes)
    	<ul>
	    <li>how would you mock-up what?</li>
	    <li>whom would you ask to use it how?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> consider new technologies (e.g. languages, tool kits, APIs, services)
    	 that you are planning to use (5-7 minutes)
    	<ul>
	    <li>what might be hard to master, or might not do what you need?</li>
	    <li>what things to you need to be assured of before you can
	    	safely base your plans on each?</li>
	    <li>what is the simplest project that would answer each question?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> be prepared to share what you discover
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="quality">
<H2>Quality and Quality Assurance</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Define important <em>quality</em> attributes for your product (other than code-correctness)
    	 based on your competitive research and user interviews.
    </li>
    <li> Refine those definitions to be measurable statements, and suggest a means of testing each.
    </li>
    <li> Suggest things you can do (in your design and development process) to ensure each.
    </li>
    <li> Be prepared to share your results
    </li>
</UL>

<A name="U/I">
<H2>User Interface Design</H2>
<UL>
    <li> Consider your application
    	<ul>
	    <li>enumerate the key information content elements</li>
	    <li>enumerate the key user goals/tasks</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> in that context
    	<ul>
	    <li>identify natural task based navigation paths</li>
	    <li>identify natural content structure relationships</li>
	    <li>note the information to be gathered or displayed on each path</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> be prepared to share with the class
    	<ul>
	    <li>what was obvious and/or simple (not a problem)?</li>
	    <li>what was not obvious/simpe, and what did you decide?</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</UL>
