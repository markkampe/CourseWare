<H3>Git and GitHub</h3>
<P>
You will need to get set up on <em>GitHub</em> and learn basic <em>git</em> use.
I have created a 
<A href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/markkampe/Big-Software/blob/master/info/git.html">Git Cheat Sheet</A>
that:
<UL>
	<li> steps you through the getting started process</li>
	<li> points you at basic concepts and commands documentation</li>
	<li> points you at documentation on few more advanced topics</li>
	<li> provides a summary of the most commonly used git commands</LI>
</UL>
In addition to using <em>github</em> for version control, you will almost
surely want to use it to track the many tasks associated with each project.
I strongly encourage you to use:
<UL>
	<li> <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues">
		GitHub Issues</a> to describe all the work that must be done</li>
	<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards">
		GibHub Project Boards</a> to organize and track the status of
		the work to be completed next
	    <ul>
		<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-project-board">
			Creating Project Boards</A></li>
		<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-a-project-board">
			Editing Project Boards</A></li>
		<li> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board">
			Adding Issues to a Project Board</A></li>
	    </ul>
	</li>
</UL>

</p><h3>McConnell, chapters 10-19</h3>
This course involves considerable reading ... and yet it touches only
only superficially on many important subjects.  The projects require
so much planning activity that there is little time left for actual
implementation.  I believe (and I hope you will agree) that this course
will make very good use of the semester ... but many students enter this
course hoping to gain more, and large-project, programming experience.
I respect this desire, but I couldn't find enough hours in the semester.
</P><p>
The primary text for this course (McConnell, Code Complete) actually
has several excellent chapters on coding and programming issues.  The
only reasons I do not assign them are:
</p><ul>
   <li> they would turn a heavy reading burden into a crippling one.
   </li><li> they are outside of the key learning objectives that I have
 	established for this course.
</li></ul>
If, however, you want to be exposed to a well articulated collection
of programming lessons that it normally takes a decade or more to learn, 
I strongly recommend that you read (and carefully study) chapters 10-19
of Code Complete.

<h3>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</h3>
<P>
This book by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides (the Gang of Four) is 
considered by many to be one of the foundations of object oriented design.
Design patterns will not solve all of your problems, but studying and 
using them will make you a better programmer.  I did not make it required
reading for this class because it would have taken us too deeply into
programming, but if you have not already read it, I strongly encourge
you to do so.
