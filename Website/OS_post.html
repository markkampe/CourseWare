<h2> Quizzes</h2>
<P>
There is a (Sakai) quiz that must be completed prior to each lecture session.
These are timed (5 mintues) closed book quizzes intended to be non-difficult 
if you have done the reading.  Most questions can be answered in a one-digit
number of words.  
I am not looking for essay answers or even complete sentences ... just enough
to show that you remember a few details from the reading.
