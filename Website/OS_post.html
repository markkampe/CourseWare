<h2> Quizzes</h2>
<P>
There is an (on-line) quiz that must be completed prior to each lecture session.
These are timed (~10 mintues) closed book quizzes intended to be non-difficult 
if you have done the reading ... but perhaps confusing if you haven't.
Most questions are multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank.
